## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Hello, I'm Ashish Kujur, originally from [Rourkela, Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rourkela), currently pursuing my PhD at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/).

I earned my Bachelor's degree from [Loyola College, Chennai](https://www.loyolacollege.edu/), and completed my Master's degree at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. Under the guidance of [Md. Ramiz Reza](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/ramiz), I pursued my master's thesis, and I am continuing my doctoral studies at the same institution under his supervision.

Apart from pure mathematics, I find joy in playing the guitar and exploring [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). I am open to connecting and collaborating, so please feel free to reach out.

## Research Interest(s)

I am currently studying Operator Theory on Hilbert spaces of Analytic Function Spaces.
