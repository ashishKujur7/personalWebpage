## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am Ashish Kujur, a student of Mathematics from [Rourkela, Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rourkela). Currently, I am a first year PhD student of Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). My PhD advisor is [Md. Ramiz Reza](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/ramiz).

I did my bachelor's at Loyola College, Chennai, and my master's at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. 

Apart from math, I like exploring [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and playing the guitar. I'm open to meeting new people and collaborating. Feel free to reach out!

## Research Interest(s)

I am currently studying [Operator Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_theory) on [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space) of [Holomorphic Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function).

## Publications

Hopefully, coming soon?

> There are two ways to do great mathematics. The first is to be smarter than everybody else. The second way is to be stupider than everybody else -- but persistent.
>
> — Raoul Bott 

> The Germans have aptly called Sitzfleisch the ability to spend endless
hours at a desk doing grueling work. Sitzfleisch is considered by mathematicians to be a better gauge of success than any of the attractive definitions of talent with which psychologists regale us from time to time.
>
> — Gian-Carlo Rota
